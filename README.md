# Stream Rent
The Stream Rent project allows users to create NFTs out of any offchain resource they might have, and gain income by renting them out. It also allows other users to rent the resources they need and only pay for as long as they possess the resources.

## Frontend
To start the frontend to the project, run the following commands.
```
cd streamrent
npm install
npm start
```
